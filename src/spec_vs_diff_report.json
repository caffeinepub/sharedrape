  "summary": "The diff successfully implements REQ-26 by replacing empty string values in Select.Item components with non-empty placeholder values ('all-sizes', 'all-occasions') and converting them back to empty strings in state management. The implementation covers size and occasion filters as requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Ensure color and city Select.Item components have non-empty string values",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly mentions fixing Select.Item for 'size, occasion, color, and city filters', but the diff shows color and city are implemented as Input components, not Select components with SelectItem. The fix was only applied to size and occasion dropdowns.",
